# XGBoost Regression with Jupyter Notebook

This project demonstrates how I used an XGBoost Regressor on advanced NBA statistics for predicting NBA playoff wins using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It uses the [nba_api](https://github.com/swar/nba_api) client to extract the data needed for this project
##  Overview

The notebook walks through the end-to-end process of:
- Extracting dataframes from the nba website using the nba api client
- Loading and preprocessing data
- Visualizing the data
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training an XGBoost regression model
- Evaluating model performance using RÂ² score
- Visualizing predictions and feature importance
- Predicting who is most likely to win 16 games

##  Technologies & Libraries
